Description:

        Optimizes and defragments files on local volumes to
        improve system performance.

Syntax:

        defrag <volumes> | /C | /E <volumes> [<task(s)>] [/H] [/M [n] | [/U] [/V]] [/I n]

        Where <task(s)> is omitted (traditional defrag), or as follows:
                /A | [/D] [/K] [/L] | /O | /X

        Or, to track an operation already in progress on a volume:
        defrag <volume> /T

Parameters:

        Value   Description
        /A      Perform analysis on the specified volumes.
        /C      Perform the operation on all volumes.
        /D      Perform traditional defrag (this is the default).  On a tiered volume
                though, traditional defrag is performed only on the Capacity tier.
        /E      Perform the operation on all volumes except those specified.
        /G      Optimize the storage tiers on the specified volumes.
        /H      Run the operation at normal priority (default is low).
        /I n    Tier optimization would run for at most n seconds on each volume.
        /K      Perform slab consolidation on the specified volumes.
        /L      Perform retrim on the specified volumes.
        /M [n]  Run the operation on each volume in parallel in the background.
                At most n threads optimize the storage tiers in parallel.
        /O      Perform the proper optimization for each media type.
        /T      Track an operation already in progress on the specified volume.
        /U      Print the progress of the operation on the screen.
        /V      Print verbose output containing the fragmentation statistics.
        /X      Perform free space consolidation on the specified volumes.

Examples:

        defrag C: /U /V
        defrag C: D: /M
        defrag C:\mountpoint /A /U
        defrag /C /H /V
